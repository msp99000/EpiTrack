# EpiTrack
EpiTrack is an advanced machine learning project designed to predict seizure states (ictal, preictal, or interictal) from electrical signals in EEG data. This project leverages a robust ensemble approach, combining five distinct machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.
